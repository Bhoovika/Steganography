# Steganography

To hide or embed a secret information (secret image) inside a cover image seamlessly with the help of edge detection method in deep learning where we can hide more data in edges and less data in non edges for achieving better embedding capacity. It helps to extract back the secret information (secret image) from the cover image with minimum loss.And to demonstrate that, in comparison to previous edge detection techniques used in deep learning, the developed edge detection method has a better amount of true edges and a lower noise ratio.
